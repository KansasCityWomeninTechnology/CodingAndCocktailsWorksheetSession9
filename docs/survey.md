# Survey {#survey}

We continuously strive for improvement but can only make things better for you, the students, if we know what you think about our sessions! Please take a minute to fill out tonight's short feedback survey so we know what areas we might want to tweak going forward. Your responses are anonymous, unless you choose to share your name and email address. We truly appreciate your thoughts.
